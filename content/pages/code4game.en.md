## [glTF]

It represents the 3D scene, likes Autodesk's FBX or Pixel's USD. [Khronos] publishes and maintains it. The glTF is good at the website. Below are some projects for it.

### [libgltf]

This is a C++ project. It can load and parse the glTF file.

In the project, it contains a C++ generator. The generator can parse the glTF scheme and create the newest C++ code.

### [libgltf_ue4]

It is a third-party library for UE4.

### [glTF for UE4]

It is a UE4 plugin and imports the glTF to UE4 Editor.
